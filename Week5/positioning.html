    <h1>Relative Positioning</h1>
    <p>
      I am a basic block element. My adjacent block level elements sit on new
      lines below me.
    </p>
    <p class="positioned">
      By default, we span 100% of the width of our parent element, and we are as
      tall as our child elememt. Our total width and height is our content +
      padding
    </p>
    <p>
      We are separated by our margins. Because of margin collapsing, we are
      separated by the width of one of our margins, not both.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inline elements <span>like this one</span> and <span>this one</span> sit
      on the same line as one another
    </p>
